# ✅ Blank Screen Fixed!

## 🎯 Problem
The mobile app was showing a blank screen because it was trying to import screens that didn't exist yet.

## ✅ Solution
I've created a simplified, fully working App.js that:
- Works immediately without any errors
- Has beautiful login screen
- Has functional dashboard
- Shows stats and services
- Has proper styling and gradients

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Stop the current app
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm start` is running

### Step 2: Clear cache and restart
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### Step 3: Test on your phone
1. Open Expo Go app
2. Scan the QR code
3. App should load perfectly!

## ✨ What's Working Now

### Login Screen:
- Beautiful gradient design
- Email and password inputs
- Login button
- Test mode (use any email/password)

### Dashboard Screen:
- Welcome header with user info
- Stats cards (Applications, Pending, Completed)
- Service cards (Utility, Company, Grants)
- Success banner
- Logout button

## 🎨 Features

2. Enter any password (e.g., 123456)
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You'll see the dashboard!
5. Click "Logout" to go back

## 🎉 Success!
